# Uber Trip Analysis for January and February 2015 (Using Power BI)
This Power BI project analyzes Uber trip data for January and February 2015 to deliver interactive dashboards that uncover urban mobility trends and operational performance. It integrates data segmented by dispatching base number, trip volume, vehicle activity, day of the week, and date. The dashboards highlight key performance indicators such as total trips, active vehicles, trips per vehicle, and peak activity days. Visualizations include trend lines, bar charts, comparative heatmaps, and summary tables for in-depth temporal and base-level analysis. The solution enables users to explore demand patterns, dispatch efficiency, and time-based utilization, supporting data-driven decisions in ride-hailing operations.

## Objectives of the project

1) To track and visualize Uber trip activity during January and February 2015 through KPIs like total trips, active vehicles, and trip-to-vehicle ratio.
2) To identify top-performing dispatching base numbers in terms of trip volume and operational efficiency.
3) To analyze trip and vehicle activity trends across days of the week and months to uncover peak demand periods.
4) To explore spatial and temporal utilization patterns, helping understand the distribution of vehicle supply and rider demand.
5) To provide actionable insights via interactive and drill-down Power BI dashboards that support strategic planning and operational improvements in ride-hailing services.

## Questions solved
1) What is the total number of Uber trips recorded in January and February 2015?
2) What was the peak trip date during this period?
3) How many vehicles were actively operating, and what was the average number of trips per vehicle?
4) Which dispatching base number handled the highest trip volume?
5) How do trips and active vehicle counts vary by day of the week?
6) What are the temporal trends in trip activity across January and February?
7) Which days of the week experience the highest and lowest trip demand?
8) How efficient are different base numbers in terms of trips per vehicle?
9) What are the patterns of active vehicle deployment over time?
10) How do January and February compare in terms of trip and vehicle volume?

## Final Observations & Storyline
During January and February 2015, Uber completed a total of 4.13 million trips with approximately 462,832 active vehicles, averaging 8.92 trips per vehicle. The peak trip volume was recorded on February 28, 2015, indicating a surge in demand toward month-end. Weekly trends revealed that Fridays and Saturdays consistently had the highest trip counts, peaking at ~380K trips, while Sundays and Mondays had the lowest activity. February showed increased engagement across all weekdays compared to January, reflecting either platform growth or seasonal variation. B02764 emerged as the most active dispatch base, handling over 1.91 million trips with 217,290 vehicles, followed by B02617 and B02682, both showing strong trip-to-vehicle ratios above 9. Trend lines clearly depicted a steady increase in both trip volume and active vehicle count from January to February. Vehicle deployment mirrored trip trends, peaking midweek, with up to 40K vehicles active on peak days. Efficiency analysis showed that B02682 had the highest trip-to-vehicle ratio (9.27), suggesting better dispatch optimization. Overall, the dashboard unveils strong operational scaling and temporal demand patterns, offering actionable insights for resource planning and service improvements in urban ride-hailing.
